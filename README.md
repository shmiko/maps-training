# Google Maps and Mapbox Examples

A quick run through of some options for creating and publishing maps using Google Maps API v3 and Mapbox

## Requirements

  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
  * [bower](http://bower.io): `npm install bower -g`

## Quickstart

  * Download the repository, and run npm install && bower install to get the latest modules latest dependencies
  * Styles are provided using the Foundation library. If you wish to tweak these, you'll also need Ruby 1.9+ and Compass.
  * Important - at the time of writing, Foundation 5.4 needs SASS 3.4, which is NOT supported by Libsass.

Then when you're working on your project, just run the following command:

```bash
grunt
```
to start a static html server on [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/)

LiveReload is active, so any changes to files in the repo will trigger a browser reload.
